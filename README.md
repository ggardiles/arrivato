# Arrivato

Application that lets you share your arrival time to a certain destination with friends and family.

# Motivation

Current apps share too much information by sending realtime location to other users. I felt it would be better to only send the time to destination. This projects serves its demonstration purpose and hopefully helps other users create better applications using Google and Firebase APIs.
